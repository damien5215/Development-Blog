                <h2>All Technique</h2>
                <p>A long time ago I got bored of one of the writing groups that I belonged to and decided to explore other groups. I found one that met up in Soho and made some new writing friends who were very cool. On warm Summer evenings I used to stand outside the bar, watching them smoke and talk. One of them was Italian and the other was Swiss. The Swiss guy actually had the same name as me (“a” instead of “e”). They had studied literature at university and worked as copy editors. At these groups people would always talk of writing theories and techniques. “Point of view”, “Chekhov’s gun”, “show don’t tell”, etc. I’m not a big fan of writing rules but “show don’t tell” has stayed with me.</p>
                <p>I remember they once had a discussion about Michael Chabon and a few days ago I recently watched “Wonder Boys”, a movie based on one of his novels. The plot was intricate yet all the threads were woven together, it was an emotional roller-coaster and it had a happy ending. More than anything it’s a comedy. I liked it but something felt unsatisfying.</p>
                <p>It’s about a creative writing professor at a university in Pittsburgh, one of the teachers on a graduate writing program. It made me think of writers, in the mid-twenties, swollen with theory but devoid of life experience. They can construct novels that are full of technique but lack wisdom because it is easier to be in touch with your intelligence and ego rather than your vulnerability. This was something that the late David Foster Wallace used to worry about, especially with regard to his first novel, “The Broom of the System”. Actually it was the thing that haunted him all the way through his career. It’s hip to be <s>square</s> “ironic”. “Wonder Boys” fits into this category and that is my problem with Michael Chabon. All technique and no soul.</p>
                <p>The plot is complex but the characters lack emotional depth. Consequently it works as a comedy but the dramatic scenes feel contrived. Nobody really suffers therefore nobody really learns anything therefore nobody really changes. Well the main character, Professor Grady does change but the change seems minor. I think that is what I was disappointed by. The characters seem to have some depth and intellect however it is all a facade and illusion. It is still worth a watch but I don’t think that I'll be re-watching it any time soon. I may seek out the novel though.</p>
