                <p><span style="color:#333333;">A few months ago, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t managing my time effectively. I was spending a lot time planning things but I didn&#8217;t action many of them. Then I started watching motivational videos. There is a lot of content out there about discipline, Shaolin monks, the Navy Seals and endurance athletes. I discovered</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkqjB-2YXqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Goggins</a> <span style="color:#333333;">and couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. I love how extreme he is.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">It inspired me I tried to try some extreme exercises but my body was way too unfit for it so I gave up. What it reminded me of is that, having a long term goal and plan, is something you have to chip away at everyday. I keep a diary so I&#8217;m good at documenting things however my planning and goal-setting needed some work.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">I created an excel sheet. <span style="font-size:inherit;">The first sheet (</span><em style="font-size:inherit;">Tasks</em><span style="font-size:inherit;">) is a large list of tasks and if they are related, they are stacked next to each other. </span><span style="font-size:inherit;">The second sheet (<em>9 to 5</em>) shows the schedule for the day from 9am to 1pm and 1pm to 5pm. </span><span style="font-size:inherit;">There is a third sheet but it&#8217;s just a list of things that I may want to buy at some point in the future.</span></span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;font-size:inherit;">The S means that the task has been started and the F means it has been finished. Once a task is completed and I don&#8217;t need to see it anymore, I move it down with all the other completed tasks. The word passion just reminds me to do things with purpose and fun, to live life fully.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">I&#8217;m quite strict about the morning (9am to 1pm) and from 2pm to 5pm I&#8217;m more flexible. Ideally, at the end of each day, I create a list of things that I <strong>WANT</strong> to do and then achieve as much of it as possible. Essentially, I&#8217;ve organized almost all of my activities (coding, writing, exercise, shopping, video watching, cleaning, etc) and for the past week or two it has been extremely helpful.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Another thing that I try to do, to make tasks more engaging, is to connect them to another more pleasurable activity. When I cook, I also listen to jazz FM hoping for a good tune to come on so I can sing along. Also I used to watch a video (TV) for 20 about minutes whilst holding an abdominal crunch. I need to do that more. Two birds with one stone. With regard to coding practice, it has become habitual because of my <a href="https://github.com/damien5215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> activity bar. It&#8217;s become like a game. Every weekday I try to do at least 4 updates (push code to server). This ensures the green square for the day is a nice shade of green. Actually these green squares are probably what inspired me sub-consciously to make the &#8220;completed&#8221; squares in the excel sheet green.</span></p>
