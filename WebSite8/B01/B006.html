                <h2>Capture 31269602</h2>
                <p>She starts by saying that she’s deleted all of her videos. She likes to make videos and usually doesn’t care about making them public but sometimes she gets really emotional and deletes them. She doesn’t know what to talk about. She laughs. She likes to make videos because she likes to talk. However in real life she prefers to listen to other people. The only time she feels comfortable talking with other people is when she knows them well. She’s not insecure about what other people think of her she just has nothing to say. She says that it’s seven in the morning.</p>
                <p>She says that she likes to talk but that she doesn’t know what to talk about. She claims that she doesn’t care who visits her channel and how many subscribers she gets which is why she doesn’t use a HD camera. She doesn’t use any social media apart from this one. She doesn’t have a phone. She loves social media and the power that it has to connect people all over the world. She doesn’t use social media because she thinks that it’s really boring. When she did have a smart phone it was an old version and she had problems using it. She doesn’t care about celebrities. She’s not interested in friends of friends. When she had it she liked being able to share her thoughts but she wasn’t interested in what other people had to say. She realized that she was only interested in talking to herself which is why she makes these videos.</p>
                <p>When her phone broke she took it as a sign to stop because she wasn’t using it for anything. She hasn’t texted someone in years. She doesn’t have any worthwhile friends or the friends that she has don’t send texts. She hates technology. She likes it because knowledge is so easy to obtain but she hates the sound of keyboard typing. She doesn’t need a phone. She is not lonely. She just enjoys talking to herself. She doesn’t like writing or typing so she using her videos as a journal. She says it’s healthy to reflect but acknowledges that she is rambling rather than thinking. She is venting and venting is healthy too.</p>
                <p>She likes veganism. When she tells her friends about one of her ideas she doesn’t want to ramble and feels like they don’t listen or that they misunderstand what she is saying. She doesn’t like it when they take her too literally and judge what she says. One of her best friends has very similar opinions to her and so they rarely fight. Another one of her best friends is a guy who isn’t vegan. She has tried to argue about it with him but she thinks that he is too closed-minded but she still loves him because he is funny and is a great person. If she loves someone and they are not vegan she still loves them. The video ends.</p>
                <p><i>NOTE: This is a short story. Actually it’s more of a descriptive exercise. It doesn’t matter. It was fun to write.</i></p>
