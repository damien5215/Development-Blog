                <h2>My Novels</h2>
                <p>I have been putting the “finishing touches” on my first novel for many years now. In fact whilst doing this, I managed to write another book. I have ideas for a third however I’ve stopped myself at the ideation phase. I want to finish the first one. It’s biggest influence is my favourite novel, “The Bell Jar”. Coming-of-age, readable and confessional.</p>
                <p>The main character, a thinly disguised version of my twenty-five-year-old self, is interested in four activities; joining a writing group, binge drinking with old friends, flirting with Buddhist philosophy and trying to get to know a complicated young woman better.</p>
                <p>In the story the guy asks the girl to go to a party with him but she declines. This lack of trust leads to an argument, the argument leads to exposing deeper issues that they had with each other as teenagers and this leads to the end of the friendship. At it’s core, it’s about the guy coming to terms with the end of the friendship. It is not a love story. Well it is but the love is not “romantic love” it is “friendship love”. They are both sensitive, intuitive, intense and they have some chemistry.</p>
                <p>The challenging friendship causes the guy to go through a period of emotional growth. He learns to be honest about his feelings, to take risks and to go for what he wants, etc. It explores ideas like, the relationship between suffering and desire, how difficult it is to have a balanced friendship with someone that has trust issues, the difference between infatuation and love, how responsible are people for their actions, how this relates to identity and how does this change as people transition from teenager to their early-to-mid twenties.</p>
                <p>My second novel doesn’t have a plot, it is dialogue and character focused. After writing something so “heavy” I wanted to write something lighter and more fun, so I did. There are four students in their early twenties. On average the chapters are only five or six pages. Every chapter is based on a funny conversation between two of them. Every location is an interesting place in London. There are forty-two chapters. It is “accessible literary” fiction. It’s over 200 pages and I’ve gone over the draft a few times.</p>
                <p>The third thing that I want to write is something about jazz. I feel like I know enough and I’m very passionate about the subject. For now I think of it as a few short stories. I have the seeds of the ideas in my head. One day in the near future I need to sit down and turn them into engaging scenes. Once I have enough material I might try to shape it into something bigger. To my knowledge there has never been a decent novel about jazz. However until I’m happy with novel 1 and 2, the jazz is on hold.</p>
