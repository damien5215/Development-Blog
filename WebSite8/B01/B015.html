                <h2>Freedom and Mortality</h2>
                <p>In the mid-noughties, I used to explore the city, looking for interesting bookshops and reading philosophical books. Jean Paul Sartre and Simone De Beauvoir’s ideas on existential freedom had really affected me and I remember once reading something like, “We never felt as free as when we were under the German occupation”. I took this statement to mean, that you don’t appreciate the freedom that you possess until it becomes limited by something (wars, pandemics, etc). The lock-down has made me reflect on this.</p>
                <p>When Sartre and his contemporaries were studying philosophy, they thought a lot about how there are things in the world that we have control over and other things that we do not. The German philosopher Heidegger used the word facticity to describe the aspects of life that we can not control. So the fact that you are male or female is contingent (we do not choose our genetic code) however whether you decide to eat cereal, porridge, toast or some sort of mixture of the three for breakfast tomorrow, is up to you (provided you have enough money). This gets interesting when applied to “psychological problems” like addiction, trauma, etc. Just how much control and consequently how much responsibility does an alcoholic have over/for their actions? Human beings have free-will but it is constrained by their facticity and the level of self-control that they can exercise.</p>
                <p>Another related idea is Sartre’s formulation “existence precedes essence”. To explain this I like to think of a pair of scissors. Essentially it is a tool used to cut objects like paper and before scissors were invented the need for the tool existed. This means that the scissors were created for a specific purpose or that it’s essence or purpose existed before it existed; essence precedes existence. Theists believe that God created humans to serve a purpose (to do good and get into heaven, I think) the same way humans created scissors so that they could cut things. Sartre flipped this around. First humans exist and their lives generate meaning and purpose via the choices and actions that they commit. Mother Teresa and Adolf Hitler did very different things with their time and they are remembered differently.</p>
                <p>Our identities are a consequence of our actions and our actions are a consequence of our purpose. I value baking bread. I learn about and practice baking bread. I become a baker. The thing is that human identity is constantly in flux. Everyday an existentialist has to choose who they want to be and take responsibility for their choices. This means that we get to choose, to a certain extent, what we value, who we are and what our lives mean. This gets even more complex when you consider that it takes time to figure out what you value and want. It is common for someone in their early twenties to feel like they do not know where they fit in society because they haven’t figured out what they want and what they are good at. Generally I like to think that this stabilizes by the time they reach their mid/late-twenties.</p>
                <p>Ultimately existentialists think hard in order to become more aware and appreciative of the freedoms which they have. This is similar to another ontological philosophy. In Buddhism, one of the three marks of existence is that, living creatures are impermanent in other words everything dies. Buddhists think hard about mortality in order to become more aware (mindful) and appreciative of life. When things are going well in the world it is easy to forget about our freedom and mortality. However with the global pandemic and lockdowns, the possibility of death and suffering seems more real and as a result everybody has been forced to confront these sorts of philosophical issues.</p>
                <p><b>NOTE</b> – <i>Reading this back it seems highly evident that I did not study philosophy formally. However I’m not that fussed because I’d rather try to express my ideas and fail a bit rather than not try at all!</i></p>
