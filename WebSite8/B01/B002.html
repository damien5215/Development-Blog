                <h2>Say We’re Sweethearts Again</h2>
                <p>Harley Quinn or “Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel” first appears in the cartoon, Batman The Animated Series and I recently watched an episode. Series 2, episode 10, “Harlequinade”, 1994. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp6wLXj4-5A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scene</a> where Harley sings a jazzy tune that has funny yet dark lyrics.</p>
                <p><i>“I never knew. That our romance had ended. Until you poisoned my food. And I thought it was a lark. When you kicked me in the park. But now I think it was rude…”</i></p>
                <p>The song is called, “Say We’re Sweethearts Again” and when I searched for it, I came across a short black and white clip of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaTZoZZsb0gI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virginia O’Brien</a> singing. It was from a movie called “Meet the People” from the 1940’s and the lyrics were exactly the same. The Batman TAS writers were subtle, intelligent and had great taste; jazz, suits, dresses, gangsters, tommy guns, etc.</p>

                <p>I like the Batman of the early-to-mid nineties. Tim Burton’s gothic Batman and Batman TAS’s film-noir Batman. Both are connected by Danny Elfman’s music and both seem to be more focused on style, character and fantasy rather than content, plot and reality.</p>
                <p>Both the Joker and Harley Quinn, love having fun. However Harley’s fun seems to stem from her childlike, playful spirit and this contrasts with Joker’s more sinister personality. To a certain extent, her “immaturity” accounts for her moral flexibility and this is why I see her as neither a villain or a hero. She has a sense of humor, a pretty face and a mischievous smile.</p>
                <p>At the end of this episode, “Harley’s Holiday”, (S3, E25), Batman helps her and she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz1O7SMh_-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kisses</a> him. There is an intriguing friendship between the two opposing characters. Harley’s playfulness challenges Batman to lighten-up and Batman’s seriousness challenges Harley to focus. They <b>balance</b> each other out.</p>
