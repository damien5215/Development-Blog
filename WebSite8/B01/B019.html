                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Ernest Hemingway &#8211; A Moveable Feast</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Sylvia Plath &#8211; The Bell Jar</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Jean Paul Sartre &#8211; Nausea<br />Simone De Beauvoir &#8211; The Prime of Life<br />Miles Davis &#8211; Autobiography</strong></span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Recently I cleaned my room and part of the process involved restructuring the bookshelf. I decided to make a top five list and I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve come up with. It&#8217;s interesting that most of them were published in the early sixties, they are all U.S./French literary fiction writers and they were in the peak of the powers during the 1950&#8217;s. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>A Moveable Feast</strong> &#8211; This book was released in 1964. It&#8217;s very short and journalistic. Hemingway writing about Paris, his writing circle and visiting Sylvia Beach&#8217;s library/shop (Shakespeare and Company). It was the first literary book I read and it is the one that made a big impact on me. <em>For sale. Baby Shoes. Never worn.</em> His terse and relatively unpretentious style is something that I&#8217;ve tried to absorb.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>The Bell Jar</strong> &#8211; This book was released in 1963. This book has the balance that I value, it is both readable and interesting. It&#8217;s also a mixture of dark humour, poetic descriptions and sharp intuition. New York. 1950&#8217;s. Depression. Men and women. It is a classic example of realistic fiction and it feels confessional. The prose sometimes felt like a diary and this is something that I was attracted to because I have kept a diary since an early age.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Nausea</strong> &#8211; It was released in 1938 and is a philosophical novel about Antoine Roquentin, a writer who keeps a diary and uses it to determine how he feels and thinks about his existence as he wanders about his local town, Bouville. The novel captures a few fundamental themes of the branch of existentialist philosophy that Sartre (and Simone De Beauvoir) developed in the 1930s. These include ideas such as freedom and contingency.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>The Prime of Life</strong> &#8211; The book was published in 1960, the second volume of her three part auto-biography. This book reads like a diary, a very detailed diary. There are a lot of interesting anecdotes and it was fun to learn about living in hotels, teaching, philosophy, Sartre, Olga Kosakiewicz, the occupation of Paris and the Vichy government. I remember looking for a copy of this book in shops and learning that &#8220;Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter&#8221; (the first part of the trilogy) was the only one &#8220;in print&#8221;. I got my copy from amazon, used but good condition. It has the blue woman (Henri Matisse) on the cover. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Autobiography (Miles Davis)</strong> &#8211; Published in 1990. Miles Davis had a distinctive voice and seemed intense and brutally honest. The stories he tells about how jazz evolved during the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s are detailed and interesting. The first half of the book is excellent but the second part seems boring. In 1949 Miles visited Paris for the first time to play jazz and he fell in love with the city. I enjoyed reading that he befriended Jean Paul Sartre. The existentialists liked jazz. I wish he had written more about this.   </span></p>
