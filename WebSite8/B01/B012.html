                <h2>Quirky Movies</h2>
                <p><b>The Last Time I Committed Suicide</b> – 1997. Whilst looking for other movies that had Claire Forlani in it I came across this on iTunes and bought it. The cast is hip. Claire Forlani, Thomas Jane, Gretchen Mol, Adrien Brody, etc. The movie is weird and based on a letter between Neal Cassidy and Jack Kerouac. I like the Beat poets. They didn’t produce anything good but they were stylish and dug jazz. The movie is just like it’s subject matter, stylish but lacking in depth. I watch the movie, or at least put it on in the background for the atmosphere. It has a good soundtrack.</p>
                <img id="img1" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/sgp-catalog-images/region_GB/33hm9-456289-Full-Image_GalleryBackground-en-US-1529530217566._SX1080_.jpg" />
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>Closer</b> – Jude law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owen and Julia Robert. The movie came out in 2004 and I hadn’t really watched it properly before. This time I paid attention and I was impressed. It was based on a play so you have to watch it closely to figure out the context. All of the characters lie and do not trust each other. This leads to affairs, confessions and fights. It’s intense stuff and it’s structured in a clever way. The characters talk about love but it seems that all of them are in incapable of love. It has more to do with lust, control, games, seduction, manipulation, revenge, etc. The script is sharp and the actors do it justice. The sexual chemistry between the four of them is good. Jude and Clive play the obsession and fearlessness perfect. Julia is good at playing guilty and Natalie is good at playing manipulative, vulnerable and jaded. This story really highlights the dark side of dating and I see it a cautionary tale. Selfish people end up in abusive relationships that are one-sided.

                <br><br>
                <p><b>Grosse Pointe Blank</b> – This is a happy movie. Late-90’s optimism. Essentially it is a rom-com but the emphasis is definitely on the comedy. Deadpan comedy to be more specific. Almost every scene is funny and the characters are small-town nerds that are happy with being small-town nerds. I know most of the script by heart. The romance is good too. This is because of the “frightening natural chemistry” between Martin Blank and Debbie Newberry. When they fight it is passionate and when they have fun they regress into children. Their relationship seems to be built upon a genuine friendship. Maybe it’s something about Cusack and Driver but they just seem to connect very easily, a good match.</p>

                <p>
                    <b>Before Sunset</b> – 2004. I saw this movie in my early twenties and I loved the refreshing simplicity, the philosophical dialogue and the beautiful shots of Paris. It felt a bit like a reading a book. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke seem like good friends that can talk forever. They are very honest with each other and this creates an intimacy which is compelling to watch. There is tension and emotion which ebbs and flows and feels natural. When movies are this arty they are usually rendered unwatchable due to the self-indulgence of the people responsible however this movie works. I visited Paris around 2008. I bought a book by Sartre in Shakespeare and Company and thought about Before Sunset.

                <br><br>
                <p><b>Tart</b> – 2001. This movie has mostly negative reviews yet I like it. Lot’s of money. Too much freedom. Prep school. Teenage insecurity. New York. Divorced parents. Antisemitism. Drugs. Ephebophilia. It’s an ugly combination and the movie captured the ugliness objectively. That is probably why I liked it. It feels realistic. I like how the first character that the movie tends to focus on, seems like a terrible friend for the main character, “Catherine Storm”, played by Dominique Swain, yet by the end, you realise that she is her best friend. The characters are dysfunctional but I ended up feeling for Catherine Storm. She does stupid things but the situations are explained fully and she seems to learn from her mistakes. It’s like a story by Bret Easton Ellis but better.</p>

                <!--<br><br>
    <p><b>Hotel Room: Blackout</b> – This is a TV episode for HBO. 1993. Directed but not written by David Lynch. Creepy. Surreal. Mysterious. Atmospheric. Interesting. Perfect for Halloween. The plot feels like Stephen King. Two characters in a dark hotel room for 40 minutes, just talking, during 1937. It featured “Crispsin Glover” and “Alicia Witt”. It made me think of “Twin Peaks” Season 3 (2017) because the scene was so minimal. This is about attention. Lynch’s style forces the audience to concentrate and to really focus. TP Season 3 did the same thing. I’m sure this is because of Lynch’s transcendental meditation. A bit like the later work of Miles Davis, Lynch is all about style over content, the journey rather than the destination.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><b>High Art</b> – 1998. The movie is stylish. Drugs. Art and Business. Pretentious People. New York. LGBT. Philosophy. Photography. I like the atmosphere. It’s a drama and romance. The couple are serious about each other and they are very different. The editor gives her structure and the artist gets her to loosen up. The acting is good and so is the cast. Patricia Clarkson seemed like a real heroin addict, self-destructive and relaxed. It reminded me of Chet Baker.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><b>Bright Young Things</b> – 2003. This movie was directed by Stephen Fry and is an adaptation of a novel called “Vile Bodies” by my favourite of Fry’s 3 W’s (Wilde, Wodehouse and Waugh), Evelyn Waugh. It is part comedy, part drama and part romance. Brideshead Revisited was adapted for TV in the 80’s (Jeremy Irons, Diana Quick, etc). It is amazing. Waugh was a great writer and captured high society, the light and the dark side, without flinching however his novels can be tough to read. These adaptations from novels to TV or film are great because it helps preserve and make EW’s work more accessible. Fry’s adaptation is stylish, colorful and well cast. The only really problem that it suffers is that it is paced a little bit too fast for my taste. Also the music seemed a bit cliche. I would’ve liked to hear some more jazz, Cole Porter or Duke Ellington. It is still highly watchable and every few months or so I find myself putting it on in the background whilst doing some work.</p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>The Deaths of Chet Baker</strong> &#8211; 2009. It is a short movie which imagines a few different ways that Chet could&#8217;ve died in Amsterdam on 13th May 1988. It is only 8 minutes long and it is well-acted and stylish. It is very beautiful short story. Show don&#8217;t tell. There is some music at the start. No trumpet. Just Baker&#8217;s vocals accompanied by a bassist and pianist. All of the instruments are acoustic and the recording&#8217;s production is great. The actor really shows off Baker&#8217;s style, trumpet like singing, by holding a few of the notes, long soulful phrases. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pb3XzBqyHk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to it.</span></p>

                <br><br>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Chungking Express</strong> &#8211; 1994. The movie has two threads, two couples that meet. Both of the couples seem to be the opposite of each other. The first couple (see picture): The woman is tough, seems to be involved in dodgy deals and has a perpetual poker-face. The guy, who looks younger, is sad about breaking up with a girlfriend and seems more emotionally expressive. They share a small moment but nothing really happens. The main focus on the movie is on the second couple. A lonely policeman (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) who is serious and the young woman (Faye Wong) who works at a food stand, is chaos personified and has good taste in music. It is atmospheric and light-hearted, easy to watch.</span></p>

                <br><br>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Funland</strong> &#8211; 2005. BBC. Funland is dark comedy. It&#8217;s atmospheric, well written and well acted. A real gem. A newly wed couple go to Blackpool for a holiday. There is a lot more to the plot but it&#8217;s hard to describe let alone explain in a short paragraph. Here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funland_(TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wiki</a>.</span></p>

                <br><br>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Basquiat</strong> – 1996. I love this movie. Jeffery Wright. Claire Forlani. Michael Wincott. Benicio del Toro. Dennis Hopper. Gary Oldman. Etc. The cast is solid and so is the soundtrack. Like in most arty movies, the tone and atmosphere is more important than the plot. There are so many great scenes but I do love how he used to paint whilst listening to jazz and dancing around.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Christmas at Cartwrights</strong> &#8211; I don&#8217;t usually watch Hallmark movies but the Christmas movies that star</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlBrzjyg0ww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alicia Witt</a> <span style="color:#333333;">are fun to watch. She has made a few of them and they are atmospheric but predictable. So far I&#8217;ve seen &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pr-tlURPVs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas at Cartwrights</a>&#8221; (2014) and &#8220;Christmas List&#8221; (2016). The image below is not actually from Christmas at Cartwrights, it&#8217;s from another one, possibly &#8220;Christmas Tree Lane&#8221; (2020). They are perfect for getting into the Christmas spirit. Alicia Witt is special because she is individualistic, daring and artistic. Most Hallmark movies require the opposite attributes from their actors/actresses and this is why I like Alicia. Her acting is so good that she can be pretend to be bland, just enough to &#8220;fit in&#8221;.</span></p>
