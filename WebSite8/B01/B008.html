                <h2>School</h2>
                <p>Twenty past nine in the morning. A classroom of twenty four have been put into groups of four or five. At one of the tables four students, two guys and two girls, are sitting opposite each other. Nathan hadn’t slept properly. His head was buried in his arms which were folded on the table. Jason, Caitlin and Kelly were staring into space, daydreaming, not talking or looking at each other. Mr Collins focused on the despondent teenagers and approached them.</p>
                <p>
                    “How come you are not doing the work?”<br>
                    Nobody responded so Jason spoke for the group.<br>
                    “The assignment is too corny sir.”<br>
                    The teacher became disgruntled.<br>
                    “Just get on with it.”<br>
                    He left and Caitlin looked at Jason.<br>
                    “Stuart told me that you used to draw pictures of me in double science.”<br>
                    Jason twitched and looked at Nathan. He was smiling evilly.<br>
                    “That was in year 10, when I used fancy you.”<br>
                    Kelly’s eyes widened.<br>
                    “You, used to fancy Cait…”<br>
                    Jason interrupted.<br>
                    “USED to fancy, I’m over you now.”<br>
                </p>
                <p>Caitlin pretended to look sad and nobody believed Jason. It was funny. Nathan started to stare at Kelly which made her uncomfortable. She left to gossip with her friends, the fashion drones and Caitlin asked the guys a question.</p>
                <p>
                    “What do you think of Kelly?”<br>
                    Nathan tapped out a groove on the table.<br>
                    “She’s a Barbie doll.”<br>
                </p>
                <p>Jason nodded and Caitlin talked a little a bit about why she doesn’t like her. This disturbed Jason. If Caitlin doesn’t like Kelly then why are they friends? It made him think about how Nathan had told him that every morning, he gets a bowl, puts a small bit of cereal in there, crushes it, adds some milk and leaves it on the kitchen table before leaving the house. He was skipping breakfast because he had no time and wanted to avoid conflict. His father was difficult, especially since his mother had left a few months ago.</p>
                <p>Nathan left the table to go talk to his friends, the goths and the nerds. Caitlin and Jason talked about youth clubs, overdoses and bad dance music until the bell rang.</p>
