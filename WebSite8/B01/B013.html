                <h2>Critical Thinkers</h2>
                <p>My favourite teacher in school was my physics teacher. She was posh and very intelligent. What made her special was that she cared passionately for physics. She had a toughness about her. A discipline. A strength. A will. Maybe it had something to do with growing up in post-war Britain. Maybe not. She valued intelligence and used her prefrontal cortex at every opportunity. Whether it came to dealing with deception or explaining the photoelectric effect, she applied herself fully.</p>
                <p>I was an average student with an average aptitude. She was aware of this and so asked me difficult questions from time to time. She asked me what I wanted from life. Don’t you want to get married? To support a family you need a good job. What kind of job do you want? Does it require physics? Why are you studying physics? Why aren’t you applying yourself more? I was seventeen and was just going with the flow. I was a blank page but I was open.</p>
                <p>She liked to lecture about the difference between knowing something and understanding it. She used to say that GCSE students were spoon-fed information, memorised it for exams and then forgot it after a week or two. This presented a difficult problem for teaching A-levels because students didn’t know how to think “critically”. Essentially every time that we looked at a problem together, she taught me how to think. You look at the problem. See the big picture. Break it down. Simplify as much as possible. Work through the detail. Do not make assumptions. Be efficient. Use logic. Solve it.</p>
                <p>She told me that if you truly understood something, that you would not forget it. To this day, some of the material that we went over, that I managed to get my head around, I still have with me. I remember clearly explaining centripetal acceleration, Newton’s three laws of motion and how the moon can be described to be accelerating toward the Earth due to it’s circular path.</p>
                <p>At work I once witnessed an experienced software developer trying to assist a non-technical co-worker. They were having a bit of trouble using some software and felt frustrated and “pressurized”. Instead of “spoon-feeding”, he gave some cryptic hints hoping that this would be enough for her to make the connections and figure it out on her own. She was just getting familiar with the tools which were new to her. This perhaps was not the best solution seeing as “tool familiarity problems” tend to be like the “Columbus Egg”. Time consuming when you don’t know but simple, once-you-know-how.</p>
                <p>It reflected the education style which he had received. He was a critical thinker and he was trying to teach her, the same way he had been taught. Tough love. He valued a kind of “brute-force” approach rather than “flexibility”. For this reason I found it challenging to work with him however he did manage to teach me a great deal in a short space of time. Apart from the punk rock t-shirts, his dark sense of humor, proclivity for using expletives and hard-drinking stories, he reminded me of my physics teacher.</p>
                <p>Several years later, once I had matured and developed the mental faculties to understand the things that my physics teacher had said, I found that I had absorbed her intellectual attitude. I still had an interest in math and physics but it was not limited to just numbers and equations. It extended into philosophy, poetry and literature. Through reading “heavy” novels I acquired a humanistic education and words like truth, freedom, peace, justice and love took on more meaning.</p>
                <p>Attitude can not be taught. It has to do with wanting to be like someone. Adopting their values. It has to do with inspiration. People who have good attitudes were once deeply inspired by somebody good. Does this mean that people who have bad attitudes admire bad people? Not always. If someone has a good attitude it means that they were lucky or rich enough to meet someone who nurtured, or at least challenged, their inchoate brains. I think that bad attitudes are the product of a kind of intellectual neglect.</p>
                <p>Without “effective” role models, society conditions them into valuing celebrities, materialism and hedonism...I’m becoming didactic and I’m getting out of my depth so I’ll stop. I’m aware that a lot of this may be contentious so please take it with a fistful of salt. It’s fun to think.</p>
