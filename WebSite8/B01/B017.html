                <h2>Novel 1 Diary</h2>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>28/04/2021: HJ, C11, EDITED!</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">C11 is only 7 paragraphs (4 pages). It was easy to read, not many problems. I did use the word favourite twice when describing the bookshop and the cafe. Usually I&#8217;d force myself to be more inventive but it doesn&#8217;t bother me that much. The description of making that cup of tea is something that I&#8217;ve been sculpting for years. Initially it was very flowery, perhaps written during my Stephen Fry phase. Since then I have taken a chainsaw to it and carved out something more purposeful. I&#8217;m proud of it.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>26/04/2021: HJ, Pitch</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I sent a pitch out to an agency. My hopes are low because what I&#8217;ve written doesn&#8217;t neatly fit into the market. All the agents seem upper-middle class and the whole industry just seems narrow. I&#8217;m trying to sell it as upmarket-commercial or accessible-literary. It would be nice to get HJ published however it&#8217;s not a big deal. I like writing and I&#8217;ll continue to write. I&#8217;ve been watching videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoAYmnRX2gY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walter Mosley</a> talking and I feel very inspired. The agency that I pitched to want cover letters to be under 500 words and the synopsis to be under 1500 words. My synopsis is about 1000 words so that wasn&#8217;t a problem but getting the cover letter down to 500 took some work. I&#8217;m happy with what I came out with. The pitch is tight and the synopsis is interesting to read; the entire novel condensed into 1.5 pages. Tomorrow I will continue with polishing HJ, I&#8217;m currently on C11 (half way).</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>23/04/2021: &#8220;Afterward&#8221; vs &#8220;Afterwards&#8221;</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">There&#8217;s no difference in meaning between &#8220;afterward&#8221; and &#8220;afterwards,&#8221; but the two are generally used in separate contexts. In American English, &#8220;afterward&#8221; is more common, whereas in British English and Canadian English, &#8220;afterwards&#8221; is.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>22/04/2021: HJ, Pitch to FR<br /></b>With Walter Mosley in my head, I rewrote the cover letter. It&#8217;s good now, so good that I feel like doing something daring. I want to finish the synopsis for HJ and then send the pitch to FR, just for fun.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>20/04/2021: HJ, C9 and C10 Complete!<br /></b>C9 and C10 have been read and edited. C9 was short and mostly quirky dialogue so it was easy to do. C10 was tougher and it&#8217;s also an &#8220;emotionally heavy&#8221; chapter so I put on some Kendrick Lamar (Drank, ADHD, etc) and it was perfect. I think editing a &#8220;heavy&#8221; chapter whilst under the influence of good &#8220;melancholy&#8221; rap works well. I shall try this for the remaining chapters. Fun tunes for the fun chapters, sad tunes for the sad chapters, angry tunes for the angry chapters and beautiful tunes for the beautiful chapters.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>19/04/2021: HJ, C7 and C8 Complete!<br /></b>C7 and C8 have been read and edited. C7 was ticky because I had to rewrite the end but it works and I&#8217;m happy with it. I read/edited C8 to my &#8220;coding&#8221; playlist; Shinjiro (Harsh Mix), NIN (Head Like a Hole), etc. Tomorrow I hope to do C9 and C10. I&#8217;ll listen to the same playlist.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>17/04/2021: HJ, C7 Update<br /></b>I changed the dialogue and fixed the problem but now I need to end the scene (rewrite the last paragraph) a little bit better.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>15/04/2021: HJ, C7 Complete!<br /></b>I listened to &#8220;Window Licker&#8221; (Aphex Twin) today. Such a great piece of music. Under the influence of that song, I read through C7. It&#8217;s fine for now. I have a feeling that I could improve it in some way however I will leave it. By the time I get to C10 maybe I&#8217;ll get an idea but if I don&#8217;t, It is fine as it is. This weekend I want to finish up to C10!</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>14/04/2021: HJ, C6 Complete!<br /></b>I have completed C6. It was easy because there weren&#8217;t many things to fix however there was one problem which required a bit of tessellation. By Friday I think I can complete editing &#8220;C6 to C10&#8221;. Whilst editing C6, I listened to &#8220;Assassin&#8221; (Drill) and &#8220;Forty Ways&#8221; (Static X). Once you&#8217;re &#8220;in the groove&#8221;, the editing is easy until you actually find a problem. Then the volume is decreased and you have to think about it properly.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>11/04/2021: HJ, C4<br /></b>Below is HJ&#8217;s <a href="https://thebalancedwriter521.wordpress.com/edithj/">editing progress</a>, C1 to C5 is done apart from one section which I will do soon however I&#8217;m also moving onto C6 to C10.</span></p>

                <p><b style="font-size:revert;color:#333333;">11/04/2021: HJ, C4</b><span style="color:#333333;"><br />The NC proof copy arrived today. As soon as I&#8217;m done with the HJ proof I will move onto NC. My main focus is HJ!</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>09/04/2021: NC Proof Copy Ordered<br /></b>I have order the proof copy of NC. Whilst waiting for it I shall turn my attention to HJ this weekend.<b><br /></b></span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>08/04/2021: NC, Tightening the Blurb 2</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">The blurb is tightened. Tonight I&#8217;ll upload it to KDP and order a proof copy.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>08/04/2021: NC, Tightening the Blurb 1</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I finished checking the page numbers and the font size. It&#8217;s ready. All I&#8217;m doing is tightening the blurb.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>08/04/2021: NC, Page Numbers + Font Size</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Instead of reading it all, I&#8217;ll just make sure the format (font size, page numbers, etc) is okay for the whole document. When it&#8217;s good I&#8217;ll print the proof copy. Then I&#8217;ll edit the proof because it&#8217;s easier. Under the influence of Static X (Cult of Static), I&#8217;ve just checked the formatting up to page 100 (C21). I should be done with this check by this evening and then I want to order the proof.  </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>06/04/2021: NC, C1</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I just finished reading/editing NC, C1. There is one line that I want to change. &#8220;<em>The man in the purple shirt walked back to his counter</em>&#8220;. I want to replace it with a detail about the shop or Adam.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b>05/04/2021: General Update<br /></b><em>Prints writing at shop.</em></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Drives to train station.</em></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><em>LWC: Talks to Lucy.</em></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Jason reads DWTP.</em></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Talking at the bar.</em></span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">30/03/2021: HJ Editing &#8211; C4</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">On one sheet of paper I&#8217;ve mapped out the structure of C1 to C5. I also swapped C4 with C5. I just need to read and edit C4 and then this section is done. I&#8217;ve broken C4 into 5 sub-sections. I will focus on them this week &#8211; </span></p>

Once all of it has been formatted, I&#8217;ll print a proof copy. Then I&#8217;ll have to give it a little edit after I finish editing HJ. I&#8217;ve decided that the toilet is the quietest room in the house therefore it is one of the best places to read. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">21/03/2021: HJ Editing &#8211; Page 23</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">So far, I&#8217;ve read and edited 22 pages. Tomorrow, if I manage to do C3 and C4, that will take me up to page 32. C5 is about 20 pages so maybe I&#8217;ll do that over two days. That will take me up to page 52 and then I&#8217;ll have to update the synopsis.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">20/03/2021: HJ Editing &#8211; Page 9</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">I&#8217;ve spent about an hour editing this evening (Static X in the background (volume = 40%)). I managed to edit up to the start of page 9. There is no way I will edit 40 pages this weekend. I may do up to page 20 or 25 but 40 is unrealistic. If it wasn&#8217;t for lock-down and the virus, I would do what I used to do. Go to the library, work for 45 minutes, go for a walk, find a comfortable cafe, drink tea and edit for another 45 minutes. If I aim to read/edit 10 pages a day, I&#8217;ll be done in 3 weeks. That&#8217;s going to take some discipline but I&#8217;ll try to do it. I&#8217;m going to have to make at least 3 &#8220;hypnotic&#8221; playlists to work to.  </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">20/03/2021: HJ Editing (Page 2)</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;&#8230;so <strong>that</strong> he could pass through&#8230;&#8221;, I was missing a &#8220;that&#8221;. Apparently it has something to do with adverb clauses. I really have very little respect for tiny grammar rules however I do want the book to read well, so I&#8217;ll have to put in some effort.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">20/03/2021: HJ Editing (Page 2)</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">I read the first few pages and I&#8217;m really impressed by how it looks. I caught a minor issue on page 2. The paragraph was a bit clunky however I fixed it by adding two, &#8220;well-placed&#8221;, commas. Punctuation is important. This weekend I want to get 40 pages done however that might be a bit ambitious.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">15/03/2021: Printing HJ Proof Copy</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">I changed the font size to 12 and checked the pagination. HJ seems good enough to do the final edit now. I&#8217;ll try to read and analyse it as five, 40-page chunks. Once I complete reading and notating one of these chunks, I will revamp the synopsis and cover letter. It should arrive on Thursday (18th).</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><b style="color:#333333;">14/03/2021: Contemporary Social Realism</b><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;">I have formatted the first 4 chapters (up to page 19) using the same settings as HJ. This may take a day or two.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>14/03/2021: HJ is 99% Formatted For KDP<br /></strong></span><span style="color:#333333;">HJ is finally formatted to the point of printing. The font is now 12 and I fixed the starting pages. I do need to check the page numbers but once that is done, I can print the final proof. I&#8217;m also trying to Format NC the same way.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>11/03/2021: One More Chapter (C22)<br /></strong></span><span style="color:#333333;">I solved a structural problem for C23 and C24. I took a chunk out of C24 and managed to integrate it into C23. There is just one more chapter to format (C22). I&#8217;ll try to do it tonight.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>09/03/2021: P151<br /></strong></span><span style="color:#333333;">Just 50 more pages. I should finish formatting tomorrow.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>08/03/2021: Page 131<br /></strong></span><span style="color:#333333;">Actually I should finish formatting the novel tonight. I want to order a new proof copy as soon as possible so that I can read and do a &#8220;final&#8221; edit, hopefully this weekend. Whilst waiting for the second proof copy to arrive I can set up the YT channel. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>07/03/2021: Page 81<br /></strong></span><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;Static X &#8211; Permanence&#8221; is a good track to edit to. Also the whole Regeneration album is good. I spotted a small problem on page 23, the page number was on the wrong side. Also on page 52, the start of chapter 6, the same thing happened. I&#8217;ve edited it up to page 81, the first 9 chapters. So essentially over 1/3 of the novel is good. I still think it will take about 2 weeks to get it into shape so that I can print out another proof copy. Then that has to be read all the way through.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>06/03/2021: KDP Edit: 10 Pages a Day <br /></strong>The text in the proof copy seemed a bit small and on each page, there were 36 lines of text. On average it should be about 33 lines. I changed the font size from 11 to 12 and now there are 33 lines on each page. I need to go through the whole novel again, no cheating. In one go, I tend to edit/polish 5 pages. This is because editing is much more intensive then just reading. I shall adjust my editing &#8220;sprints&#8221; to this. If I aim to edit 10 pages a day then it will take about 18 days.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>06/03/2021: KDP: Proof Copy<br /></strong>The book came. It looks good but I want to change the font size. I will read it all the way through, making small corrections as I go. I think it will take a week. Then I&#8217;ll get the YT channel together and publish it. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>05/03/2021: KDP: Waiting for Proof Copy<br /></strong>Chapter 14 may have a small issue. I forgot to delete a few place-holder lines from the template.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>03/03/2021: KDP: I&#8217;ve order a copy for proof-reading<br /></strong>I&#8217;ve ordered a copy for proof reading. It will come next week, probably coming from the U.S. Whilst I wait, I will work on the marketing and maybe take a look at novel 2, perhaps push it out to a few agents.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>02/03/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: EDIT<br /></strong>I&#8217;ve formatted all the pages, now I need to do two things, look at the page settings of the document and print a test copy for proof-reading.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>28/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: C6<br /></strong>I edited 5 pages which means I finished C6 and I&#8217;m looking at C7.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>27/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: C5, C6<br /></strong>Today I edited 15 pages so C5 is fine now and I&#8217;m half way through C6. I think I should aim to edit 20 pages everyday. I still have about 140 pages to go through. At this rate, I would be done in 7 days (Sunday 7th March 2021).</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>27/02/2021: Speech marks inside speech marks rule<br /></strong>Use single quotation marks inside double quotation marks when you have a quotation within a quotation. Example: Bobbi told me, “Delia said, &#8216;This will never work.'&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>26/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: C2, C3 and C4<br /></strong>I transferred, read and edited C2, C3 and C4. I&#8217;m currently doing C5. It is one of the longest chapters in my novel and I still have 10 pages to go.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>26/02/2021: C4, Names and Continuity<br /></strong>Jack = (Steven)<br />Mark = (Matthew R)<br />Martin = (Meryn) <br />Jenny = (Jenny)<br />Caitlin = (Ciara)</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>25/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: C2<br /></strong>I&#8217;ve been reading and editing the chapters to prodigy tracks like &#8220;Narayan&#8221; and &#8220;Roadblox&#8221;.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>24/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback: C1<br /></strong>I read through the transferred text for C1 and noticed little errors that I didn&#8217;t see before when it was just a word document (font 12, times new roman, double spaced, A4). Editing it in this form is even better because it is in the correct format. As I reformat the chapters I&#8217;ll have to read it again so I can catch little errors. Chapter 1 brings back a lot of memories for me and it is good.</span></p>


















                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>23/02/2021: KDP, Format Paperback<br /></strong>I downloaded the KDP template (word document) for a paperback. I compared the margin and trim size to my copy of &#8220;The Bell Jar&#8221;. I thought that I&#8217;d have to do a lot of tweaking however it already looks pretty good. Tomorrow I want to format chapter 1 to chapter 5 (the first 40 pages).  </span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>22/02/2021: Plan<br /></strong>I&#8217;m planning to make a YT channel for the book. I&#8217;ve thought of a name, and have and idea for the intro video (a manifesto, talking about &#8220;genre versus literary&#8221; and defining the term &#8220;accessible literary&#8221;). I made it and it looks pretty good. I want to make a video of the paperback, show off it&#8217;s dimensions, flick the pages, check the typography, admire the cover, etc. In the description of the video I will put the blurb and a few other details (influences, themes, genre, etc). What I need to do next is actually use KDP and order/print one test copy so I can do one last &#8220;spell check&#8221;. Once, I&#8217;m happy I&#8217;ll publish it and then I&#8217;ll have to think about ways to market it online.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>21/02/2021: ALMOST ENTIRE NOVEL EDITED!<br /></strong>I want to recheck C1 to C5. The novel is only 170 pages but that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m breaking quite a few rules with this project. I&#8217;m going to look into publishing it via Amazon (KDP), an e-book and a paper-book. I wrote this novel for me and my friends. I&#8217;ll have to research how to design the cover and format/typography. My idea is to keep it simple and base it on &#8220;The Bell Jar&#8221; as much as possible. Then there is digital marketing. As for the second novel, I&#8217;ll try to sell it to agents and I&#8217;ll give it another edit. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>20/02/2021: C25 Plan<br /></strong>C24 is done. It was tricky to tie up the loose ends but I did it. C25 should be a lot easier to edit because the dialogue doesn&#8217;t need extending, just checking.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>20/02/2021: C24 Edit In Progress<br /></strong>I extended the dialogue. It&#8217;s good and pushes the chapter from 5 pages to about 7. I need to insert some more action/description to go with the extra dialogue.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>18/02/2021: C20 Edit Complete<br /></strong>This week has been very productive. I have edited C16 to C20. Now I can concentrate on editing and tweaking the ending. C21 should be easy.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>18/02/2021: C20 Plan<br /></strong>C20 is 14 pages however it shouldn&#8217;t be difficult to edit. It just needs tweaking. By the end of this week (SUN 21 FEB 2021), I&#8217;m aiming to finish C16 to C20. Then I can move onto C21 to C25. Hopefully by Sunday 28th February 2021, the final draft of HJ will finally be <strong>FINISHED!</strong></span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;">C19 is going to be tough because I need to write it. I have an idea for the structure (beginning, middle and end) but it may take a day or two to flesh out and polish. Having said that I think I could bang it out in one day (3 to 4 hours).</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>15/02/2021: C16 Edit Complete</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;Chop Him!&#8221; is done. It was only 5 pages. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>12/02/2021: C15 Edit Complete</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I edited all of chapter 15 (Finding my Spine). It took 2 to 3 hours and it&#8217;s a good chapter.</span></p>



                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>11/02/2021: C14 Edit, P1 to P14</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I edited all of Chapter 14 (Team Work). It was 7 pages and took about 2 hours to edit. It was easy to edit because the chapter is dialogue-heavy. Easy to read, easy to edit. C15 (Finding My Spine) is about 8 pages and it is mostly diary entry. I have a feeling it may take 3-4 hours. It is one of the most important chapters in the novel.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>08/02/2021: C13 Edit, P11 to P21</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Chapter 13 is now fully edited, all 8 pages, it took 6 days! It was &#8220;involved&#8221; because it&#8217;s a diary entry. Chapter 14 is 7 pages but I&#8217;m not worried because it is a normal scene, two characters, lots of dialogue, essentially the text is not as dense.</span></p>
                <img class="customCentered" src="https://thebalancedwriter521.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/qqq1.png" />

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>07/02/2021: C13 Edit, P3 to P10</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I edited 7 paragraphs. They&#8217;re actually relatively easy to read. I&#8217;m just doing a bit of polishing.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>05/02/2021: C13 Edit, P2</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Whilst editing P2 I came across an interesting problem &#8211;</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;&#8230;at it&#8217;s center&#8221; versus &#8220;&#8230;at it&#8217;s centre&#8221;. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">After consulting <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/center-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grammerly</a>, I have opted for, &#8220;&#8230;at it&#8217;s center&#8221; &#8211; </span></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Center and centre have the same meaning. Center is the correct spelling in American English, but British English writers usually prefer centre. Notice that center (and centre) can be a noun, adjective, or a verb. Seeing the two words in real-life examples may help you to visualize how to use them.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>04/02/2021: C13 Edit, P1</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">P1 is 76 words, quite short but I have polished it carefully. Jason enters Paul&#8217;s house.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>03/02/2021: C13 Edit, THINK</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">This chapter, &#8220;Paul&#8217;s Party&#8221;, is relatively long, just over 8 pages. It&#8217;s also a kind of first-person diary, my least favourite style to read. I&#8217;ve decided to italicize the bits of the novel which are from Jason&#8217;s diary and try to keep them to a minimum. A scene with action, dialogue, description and inner-thoughts, all interspersed with each other, is so much more fun to read than a diary entry. </span></p>

                <p>
                    <strong>03/02/2021: C12 Edit, P1 to P7</strong><br />
                    Chapter 12 (Uni Library) is now finished (editing). It was easy to edit because it is mostly dialogue.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>02/02/2021: C11 Edit, P6 + P7</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">P6 contained a detailed description of making tea. It needed a lot of trimming. P7 is a collection of memories, J and M in café talking about ontological philosophy. C12 is now finished!</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>01/02/2021: C11 Edit, P4 + P5</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I&#8217;ve edited paragraphs 4 and 5. Paragraph 5 is a block of dialogue but I&#8217;m still going to use the word &#8220;paragraph&#8221;. On average each paragraph is about 100 words.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>28/01/2021: C11 Edit, P2 + P3</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I edited the second paragraph (122 words) and third paragraph (117 words). Both paragraphs are about &#8220;Nausea&#8221; and it was a challenge to explain why it had such a big impact on Jason in 250 words.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>27/01/2021: C11 Edit, P1</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I edited the first paragraph. It needed a lot of trimming because I wrote this this a long time ago. It&#8217;s 89 words now.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>21/01/2021: C9 Re-write </strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I re-wrote the dialogue for C9. It works now. Next I need to integrate the action and C9 is done.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>29/11/2020: Revised Plan</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Now I can turn my attention to C11 to C15. I will read C11, annotate it, print it, read it again then repeat the process for C12.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>22/11/2020: Restructuring</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I moved something from C09 and put it in C06 and then deleted C09. It is a short scene mostly dialogue between Jason and Leon. I will keep editing the novel and once it&#8217;s done I&#8217;ll go back and then possibly re-write it. It&#8217;s best to build the skeleton before you build the muscles.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>15/11/2020: Annotating C6</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I bought a laser printer two weeks ago and printed out the first 80 pages of UC. I know that C1 to C5 is fine so I focused on C6 to C10. I&#8217;ve just finished decorating C6 with annotations and now I need to type up the corrections. That is easy and can be done whilst listening to music. C6 was difficult because it needed a lot of pruning. C7, C9 and C10 should be easy. C8 may be tricky. Hopefully by the 23rd I will have finished editing &#8220;C6 to C10&#8221;.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;">I need to print all of these chapters out.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>20/08/2020: Chapter 7</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">I&#8217;ve read and bullet pointed the first 7 chapters and I need to read chapter 8. I skimmed it and it seems to have some issues. I need to look at it again.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>01/08/2020: First Novel Schema<br /></strong>For every chapter I have created a list and each item on the list represents a paragraph. I’ve done this for the first forty pages and typed this list in an excel file. Being able to see everything “globally” should make the editing process easier. The next time I write an entry hopefully I will have done a few more chapters. </span></p>
