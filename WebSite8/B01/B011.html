                <h2>My Novels</h2>
                
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">I have been putting the “finishing touches” on my first novel for many years now. In fact whilst doing this, I managed to write another book. I have ideas for a third however I’ve stopped myself at the ideation phase. I want to finish the first one. It’s biggest influence is my favourite novel, “The Bell Jar”. Coming-of-age, readable and confessional.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The main character, a thinly disguised version of my twenty-five-year-old self, is interested in four activities; joining a writing group, binge <a href="https://thebalancedwriter521.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/drinking01-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drinking</a> with old friends, flirting with Buddhist philosophy and trying to get to know a complicated young woman better.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">In the story the guy asks the girl to go to a party with him but she declines. This lack of trust leads to an argument, the argument leads to exposing deeper issues that they had with each other as teenagers and this leads to the end of the friendship. At it’s core, it’s about the guy coming to terms with the end of the friendship. It is not a love story. Well it is but the love is not “romantic love” it is “friendship love”. They are both sensitive, intuitive, intense and they have some chemistry.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The challenging friendship causes the guy to go through a period of emotional growth. He learns to be honest about his feelings, to take risks and to go for what he wants, etc. It explores ideas like, the relationship between suffering and desire, how difficult it is to have a balanced friendship with someone that has trust issues, the difference between infatuation and love, how responsible are people for their actions, how this relates to identity and how does this change as people transition from teenager to their early-to-mid twenties.</span></p>

                <img id="img1" src="https://thebalancedwriter521.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/book1.png" />

                <p><span style="color:#333333;">My second novel doesn’t have a plot, it is dialogue and character focused. After writing something so “heavy” I wanted to write something lighter and more fun, so I did. There are four students in their early twenties. On average the chapters are only five or six pages. Every chapter is based on a funny conversation between two of them. Every location is an interesting place in London. There are forty-two chapters. It is “accessible literary” fiction. It’s over 200 pages and I’ve gone over the draft a few times.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The third thing that I want to write is something about jazz. I feel like I know enough and I&#8217;m very passionate about the subject. For now I think of it as a few short stories. I have the seeds of the ideas in my head. One day in the near future I need to sit down and turn them into engaging scenes. Once I have enough material I might try to shape it into something bigger. To my knowledge there has never been a decent novel about jazz. However until I&#8217;m happy with novel 1 and 2, the jazz is on hold.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>WRITE EVERY DAY</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Walter Mosely talks about his main writing rule being “write every day”. This reminded me of what I wrote about productivity and discipline. Over time, small and consistent efforts add up to something large.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>EDIT TO MUSIC</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Read and edit, fun/angry and sad/beautiful chapters, to fun/angry and sad/beautiful music. Make playlists for editing. All songs must groove hard.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>WRITING GOALS</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Read, edit and polish HJ.</span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Read, edit and polish NC.</span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Work on jazz short stories (SL).</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>READING BOOKS</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Walter Mosely, &#8220;Is it better to read 50 books once or 10 books, five times each?&#8221; I have not read widely but I have read a lot, the same books, over again. A book is worked on for a long time and usually contains a number of layers and threads which allows for multiple readings. The same goes for my favourite movies and TV shows. I&#8217;ve seen Ripley, Joe Black, Grosse Pointe, Ed, etc, many times and often notice things that I didn&#8217;t before because my perspective has changed slightly. Also do you really need to listen to Elvis if you&#8217;ve already listened to a lot of Chuck Berry?</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>INFLUENCES</strong><br />When asked about influences, Stephen Fry always cites three authors that had a big impact on him, the three W&#8217;s, Woodhouse, Waugh and Wilde. My style was influenced by what I enjoyed reading when I first started reading novels. Hemingway&#8217;s concision, Plath&#8217;s honesty and Sartre&#8217;s intelligence, Bret Easton Ellis&#8217;s dark wit and Fry&#8217;s readability.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>REALITY VS FANTASY</strong><br />Recently I heard Alan Moore talk about playing with the rules of a specific genre, dismantling them and then creating something new. I suppose this is how fantasy writers write. They rearrange ideas about the world from a relatively detached perspective. My method seems to be to write about something that happened to me, and that I am passionate about, then sometime if I&#8217;m lucky, I find a way to carve out a narrative structure. I&#8217;m concerned with journey rather than destination therefore I may never come up with an amazing plot but I&#8217;m sure that some of my characters are quite interesting.      </span></p>
