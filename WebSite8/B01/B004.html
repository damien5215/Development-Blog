                <h2>Tom Hollander’s voice makes the medicine go down</h2>
                <p>Every time that I used to pick up a copy of A Clockwork Orange in a bookshop, I used to try to read the first five pages but always gave up. “Nadsat” seemed too intimidating perhaps because when I started reading literature, I started with Hemingway. All the writers that I liked seemed to be influenced by his concision, minimalism and accessibility (For sale: baby shoes, never worn). I was about to give up on Clockwork and then I discovered that Tom Hollander had recorded it as an audio-book.</p>
                <p>For the next month, during my commute, stuck in traffic, on the tube or walking through a park, I listened to it. Tom has a good voice and when the story came to the end, I got that feeling. The feeling of not wanting it to be finished because it had been so enjoyable and routine. Having said that there are problems with the novel. AB admitted this in many interviews. It was didactic and exaggerated, just an experimental project that he felt that he had to do. The fun of the story lies in AB’s inventive use of language (theology, slang, Russian, Elizabethan poetry, etc).</p>
                <p><i>“Come, gloopy bastard as thou art. Think thou not on them. They’ll be life like that down here most likely, with some getting knifed and others doing the knifing.”</i></p>
                <p>At the start of the audio-book there is an introductory essayistic note. AB was explaining the context of the novel. How he felt about it, Kubrick’s film adaptation and the differences between the American and British publications. It is 15 minutes long and is very interesting. As with most academic writers, their non-fiction tends to be better than their fiction.</p>
