                <h2>Just Business</h2>
                <p>We were driving back to the office and she wanted to know what I thought of her because it was my last day. She claimed that she wanted to know how she could improve. I was always professional with her and never revealed anything personal because she is funny and intelligent but she is deceptive, superficial, disingenuous, secretive, immature, irresponsible, reactionary, vindictive, materialistic, lazy, unfair and selfish.</p>
                <p>In a play by Jean Paul Sartre, “Huis Clos”, he envisioned hell as something like being stuck with your opposite in a lift. That’s why it was tough. I enjoy telling the truth and she enjoys lying. The thing about it that makes me laugh is that she didn’t like her job yet she wouldn’t quit because it was comfortable.</p>
                <p>People who lie and cheat, never achieve anything real because they never challenge themselves, they always take the easiest route. They lack discipline, fortitude and endurance. It’s like the students who manage to complete a degree but can’t get a job in the field because they got someone else do their coursework and memorized material for the exams. When given a test in a job interview they fold.</p>
                <p>When she asked me that question, she just wanted me to tell her what I thought of her. I told her that she can spot opportunities, act fast and that she is tough. They’re the skills that an agent needs and therefore she had nothing to improve. I remained professional because we are not friends despite spending 38 hours a week, for one year, working with each other. It’s not that I hate her it’s just that I’m indifferent. Trust, respect and love have to be earned.</p>
