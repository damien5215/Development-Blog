                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>28/06/2021:</strong> Last night I listened to Parky&#8217;s &#8220;My Kind of Jazz&#8221; on Jazz FM, one hour on Johnny Mercer. All of the tracks were corny Hollywood movie/musical, the whitest American pop jazz (Sinatra) with a few jews (Buddy Rich). There was one Ella Fitzgerald recording which also happened to be the best track on the show. Ella Sings Mercer with Nelson Riddle&#8217;s orchestra, 1964, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3VOKUEl20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight Sun</a>&#8220;. I Remember You, is a good Mercer tune and my favourite recording of it is Charlie Parker&#8217;s version however his favourite version is Diana Krall&#8217;s. Parky seems to like the surface pop jazz which is fine but I prefer my jazz undiluted. </span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>18/06/2021:</strong> I recently listened to Charles Mingus&#8217;s tune &#8220;Goodbye Pork Pie Hat&#8221;. It&#8217;s a nice blues ballad. I can see it&#8217;s influence in Hey Arnold and Terence Blanchard&#8217;s &#8220;Malcolm X&#8221; theme. Whilst under the influence of these slower tunes I watched a documentary on Billy Strayhorn and then learned the first part on Monk&#8217;s &#8220;Round Midnight&#8221; (Ebmin, Cmin7b5, Fmin7b5, Bb7, Ebmin, G#7, Bmin7, E7, Bbmin7, Eb7, G#min7, C#7, Ebmin, G#maj, Bmaj, Bb7&#8230;).</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>12/06/2021:</strong> The weather has been good recently so I checked my tyres, bought some petrol, burned my jazz playlist to a CD and went for a drive. It was good and I realized that when I developed the playlist I grouped some of the tracks together for some interesting reasons. I have been working on this playlist since I started listening to jazz, along time ago. This playlist is 59 minutes and 40 seconds long in total. I still have 20 minutes and I sometimes put a few ballads on there but I like to keep it open in case I discover something new. </span></p>
                <p><em><span style="color:#333333;">Miles Davis &#8211; Springsville</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Roach/Brown &#8211; Daahoud</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Joey Alexander &#8211; Cotton Tail</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The tracks above are 01, 02 and 03 on my CD. They are all <strong>morning</strong> tunes that groove. Springsville is beautiful, Daahoud is intense and Cotton Tail is fun. I got the audio of Cotton Tail from a live performance on YT. The audio is good.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="color:#333333;">Joey Alexander &#8211; Resolution</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Freddie Hubbard &#8211; Thermo</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Money Jungle &#8211; Caravan</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The tracks above are 04, 05 and 06 on my CD. They are all <strong>evening</strong> tunes that groove. Resolution is elegant, Thermo is fire and Caravan is epic and a bit spooky.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="color:#333333;">Charlie Parker &#8211; Night and Day</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Coltrane &#8211; Countdown</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Guy Barker &#8211; Goodspeed</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The tracks above are 07, 08 and 09 on my CD. They are all <strong>fast</strong> tunes that groove. Night and Day is a fun big-band arrangement that is also live, Countdown is  intense and Goodsp<span style="color:#333333;">eed is raw.</span></span></p>
                <p><em><span style="color:#333333;">Blakey/Bud &#8211; Dance Of The Infidels</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Diz/Bird/Roach &#8211; A Night in Tunisia</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="color:#333333;">The tracks above are 10 and 11 on my CD. They are all <strong>party</strong> tunes that gr</span>oove. Infidel Dance, I cut the first part so it&#8217;s just Bud&#8217;s 3-minutes piano solo and the ending. The atmosphere on tis track is incredible; live in Paris in the early 60&#8217;s. This recording of A Night in Tunisia is the best that I have heard. It sounds like like fun and swings hard.</span></p>
                <p><em><span style="color:#333333;">Guy Barker &#8211; Four</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Anita O&#8217;Day &#8211; Stella By Starlight</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Julie London &#8211; You and the Night and the Music</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Charlie Parker &#8211; I Remember You</span></em><br /><em><span style="color:#333333;">Duke Ellington &#8211; U.M.M.G.</span></em></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The tracks above are 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 on my CD. They are all <strong>elegance</strong> tunes that groove. Four is from the soundtrack of The Talented Mr Ripley. Guy Barker captured how Miles and Sonny Stit were playing this tune in the early 60&#8217;s but in a condensed, more refined way, with great production. Stella By Starlight is a big-band track, early 60&#8217;s, live in Tokyo. The arrangement is nice and I like her voice. You and the Night and the Music is relaxing big-band, pop jazz. I Remember You has a medium tempo and yet Bird&#8217;s playing makes the track sparkle. UMMG is a Strayhorn composition which explains the elegant harmony and orchestration. It also features Dizzy on trumpet. The production is amazing.</span></p>

                <p><b>29-08-2019:</b> It is Charlie Parker’s centennial today. He died at 34 but what a legacy! I’ve been watching a few biographies and I came across this recording – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GxYMVA4_X4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I Remember You</a>. Al Haig (piano), Percy Heath (bass) and Max Roach (drums). The band keeps the groove steady and strong whilst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6_kbDGIBdc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bird</a> takes flight. It’s good for the morning or relaxing in the evening. The picture is not from the session but it’s so good that I put it here. </p>

                <p><b>21-08-2019:</b> Herbie Hancock – The Essence (Dj Krush Remix). I heard this tune whilst listening to jazz FM recently. It’s like chill-hop. Very relaxed and a nice beat.</p>

                <p><b>13-08-2019:</b> In 1962, after he was fired from The Blue Note Cafe (Paris), he worked at “Cafe Montmartre” in Copenhagen. I came across a two excellent videos of Bud playing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEPTvRf1m6M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Round Midnight</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaSDinL6pC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthropology</a>”. The musical chemistry between the Bud’s trio in Denmark was very nice. The bass and drummer play very simply yet with soul and this is perfect for Bud’s intricate playing. Recently I discovered a CD “Live in Lausanne 1962” (Switzerland). It contains my favourite recording of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zddWUiXqmeE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Round Midnight</a>” ever. The rhythm section supports Bud (like in Denmark) and the volume of the bass, drums and piano are balanced beautifully. Bud’s playing is risky and inventive, placing the notes and chords slightly behind or ahead of the beat.</p>
                <img id="img1" src="https://thebalancedwriter521.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/ddsquntitled.png" />

                <p><b>12-08-2019:</b> I’ve just skimmed a Buffy episode called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSJRoAA9Pj4&amp;list=PL3iO1RKxrqbYqz0v9uhx7hOjWQJME2FCq#t=10m20s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superstar</a>”, S4E17. It’s funny and it contained some good jazz (swing). In the club that they all go to (The Bronze), Jonathan and a band (Royal Crown Revue) perform “Serenade in Blue” (Glenn Miller). I was surprised by how good it sounded!</p>

                <p>
                    <img id="jazzImg1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OjH7Xco8L._SS500_.jpg">
                    <b>10-04-2020:</b> “The Malcom X Jazz Suite” is an album that Terence Blanchard released in 1993. It contains music composed for Spike Lee’s movie “Malcolm X”. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFs2RZpatzE#t=29m08s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm’s Theme</a>” is my favourite track and it is six minutes long. The hook is nice. There is a saxophone solo followed by a trumpet solo followed by a piano solo. This is a good tune to drive to at night, in summer. The recording doesn’t have the raw live energy of a classic from the early 60’s but it’s not bad for 90’s jazz.
                </p>
                <p><b>06-10-2019:</b> “A Love Supreme”, Coltrane, 1964. I listened to the album properly for the first time. Resolution is the best track and I now understand why Coltrane is so revered. The problem is that the recording of the bass is too quiet. Too quiet for a legendary recording. Then I discovered “Countdown”. It is only two minutes and twenty one seconds long but the music is so rich that it is best taken in small doses. It is my favourite Coltrane recording.</p>
                <img class="customCentered" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640x360/p058db09.jpg">

                <p><b>31-08-2019:</b> “A Flower is a Lovesome Thing”. I heard this tune by accident on YT whilst looking for Guy Barker. There is a recording (1965), a duet, piano (Billy Strayhorn) and voice (Ozzie Bailey). It is amazing. 2 years before Strayhorn died. I like it so much I bought the CD (amazon).</p>
                <p>
                    <b>22-08-2019:</b> “Moondance”, Bobby McFerrin. I heard it on Jazz FM at 6:30pm, driving home. Very weird, romantic, chilled-out and a bit creepy. It’s interesting. Worth a listen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>14-08-2019:</b> “Sky Islands”, Dianne Reeves. 1990. Modern jazz. This is a nice tune. Great for the morning. Happy. Funky. Interesting. It’s a cover of a fusion tune from the 70’s.
                </p>
                <p><b>10-08-2019:</b> I watched a documentary on Johnny Mercer. Great tunes. It’s fun to sing along with, “Too Marvelous For Words”.</p>
                <p><b>22-07-2019:</b> Jazz FM this morning. 8:15am. Nice weather. 19 degrees. “Jason Rebello – Summertime” came on. Acid jazz. Nice chords. Reminded me of J-Swift and The Pharcyde. Very chill.</p>
                <p>
                    <img id="jazzImg1" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fHnF3Tg4L.jpg">
                    <b>23-06-2019:</b> I heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swvEsprdrh0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duke Ellington</a> Money Jungle recently and for the first time I got the music. Recorded in 1963, Duke was playing like Monk. A bit like Hard Bop. Civil Rights. Max Roach. Charles Mingus. The recording of caravan is very hip and it is fun to drive to. It is one of my favourite jazz recordings.
                </p>
                <p><b>12-06-2019:</b> “Richie Cole & Eddie Jefferson – Harold’s House of Jazz”. I heard this on the drive back home (Jazz FM). It was funny. The singing made me laugh out loud. I was humming “Cherokee” all the way through it.</p>

                <p><b>04-06-2019:</b> I read Miles’s autobiography a few months ago. The first half was okay but I lost interest. It had some good gossip although the way he told the stories, it didn’t feel like gossip, it felt like the truth. It was fun to get into Miles’s mind. He was very no-nonsense, serious, direct and sharp. The reason that I lost interest is although Miles obviously lived an interesting life, he was an egotist and a book written by an egotist only has one character. One point of view. That gets tiring. However recordings like “Springsville”, that is something I will never get tried of.</p>

                <p><b>06-06-2019:</b> Last week I heard a nice recording of Art Blakey’s “Moanin” on jazz FM. Jazzmeia Horn. She’s a singer with a great tone and a lot of soul. After three minutes there is a quiet bass solo that I don’t care for.</p>


                <p><b>03-06-2019:</b> <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsZepNse3CA" target="_blank">Bopin Hood</a> is a cartoon that was in 1961. I stumbled across it whilst watching a jazz documentary. It’s funny and the music is very nice bebop. I’m going to try to transcribe some of it.</p>
                <img class="customCentered" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MsZepNse3CA/hqdefault.jpg">

                <p><b>02-06-2019:</b> Today on BBC iPlayer, “Jazz 625 Live: For One Night Only” expires. It was  nice idea but it just didn’t do the original TV programme justice. The presenter didn’t know anything about jazz and the performers were mediocre. It was “modern”. All brain and no heart. The best part was the short clip they showed of Duke Ellington’s band playing, “Take the A-Train”. Duke introduced the tune with a little story, being clever and suggestive with language (“operatic version”). Then he went over to the piano and blasted out a few bars, the horn section did their thing and the bassist sang the head before entering into a solo, the notes of which he also sang hence “operatic version”. Throughout the performance the entire band was smiling and setting each other off. Compared to the performances on the night by Joshua Redman, etc. everything seemed stiff. No one was dancing about or smiling. It was serious, modern jazz.</p>

                    <b>01-04-2019:</b> On a Sunday night, driving back from the train station and listening to sleepy jazz on the radio a good tune came on. Later on I checked the website and discovered it was “I’ve got it bad and that ain’t good”. A composition by Duke. I searched the internet for a good recording and came across Billy Strayhorn and Johnny Hodges’s version. It is the best and it is very beautiful.
