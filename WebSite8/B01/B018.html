                <h2>Literary Quotes</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Some people, from what I&#8217;ve seen, boo, when they lie, they become very still and centered and their gaze very concentrated and intense. They try to dominate the person they lie to. The person to whom they&#8217;re lying. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Another type becomes fluttery and insubstantial and punctuates his lie with little self-deprecating motions and sounds, as if credulity were the same as pity. </span></p>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Some bury the lie in so many digressions and asides that they like try to slip the lie in there through all the extraneous data like a tiny bug through a window-screen &#8230; </span></p>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Then there are what I might call your Kamikaze-style liars. These&#8217;ll tell you a surreal and fundamentally incredible lie, and then pretend a crisis of conscience and retract the original lie, and then offer you the lie they really want you to buy instead, so the real lie&#8217;ll appear a some kind of concession, a settlement with through. That type&#8217;s mercifully easy to see through &#8230; </span></p>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">Or then the type who sort of overelaborates on the lie, buttresses it with rococo formations of detail and amendment, and that&#8217;s how you can always tell &#8230;</span></p>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">So now I&#8217;ve established a subtype of the over-elaborator type. This is the liar who used to be an over-elaborator and but has somehow snapped to the fact that rococo elaborations give him away every time, so he changes and now lies tersely, sparely, seeming somehow bored, like what he&#8217;s saying is too obviously true to waste time on.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>INFINITE JEST (1996)</strong> &#8211; If you take one of David Foster Wallace&#8217;s massive chunks of text and break it up a bit, it becomes a lot easier to read.</span></p>
                <hr />
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">“It seems to me that the intellectualization and aestheticizing of principles and values in this country is one of the things that’s gutted our generation. All the things that my parents said to me, like ‘<strong>It’s really important not to lie.</strong>’ OK, check, got it. I nod at that but I really don’t feel it. Until I get to be about thirty and I realize that if I lie to you, I also can’t trust you. I feel that I’m in pain, I’m nervous, I’m lonely, and I can’t figure out why. Then I realize, ‘Oh, perhaps the way to deal with this is really not to lie.’ The idea that something so simple and, really, so aesthetically uninteresting–which for me meant you pass over it for the interesting, complex stuff–can actually be nourishing in a way that arch, meta, ironic, pomo stuff can’t, that seems to me to be important. That seems to me like something our generation needs to feel.”</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>SALON (1996)</strong> &#8211; This DFW quote comes from an interview with a literary magazine (Salon). I remember when I first heard it, it really stuck with me.</span></p>
                <hr />
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;We are the United States of Amnesia, we learn nothing because we <strong>remember</strong> nothing.&#8221;</span></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>GORE VIDAL</strong> &#8211; This is hyperbole but it is good. I may be extrapolating but to me, it describes the anti-intellectual attitude of US popular culture. Being &#8220;future focused&#8221; is great for innovation but not valuing the past can lead to devolution (Trump) rather than evolution. This is similar to what Anthony Burgess used to say about &#8220;modern art&#8221;. </span></p>
                <hr />
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">You know, it&#8217;s quite a job starting to love somebody. You have to have energy, generosity, blindness. There is even a moment, in the very beginning, when you have to jump across a precipice: if you think about it you don&#8217;t do it.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>NA<span style="color:#333333;">USEA (1938)</span></strong><span style="color:#333333;"> &#8211; This gem is from Jean Paul Sartre&#8217;s novel, &#8220;Nausea&#8221;.</span></span></p>
                <hr />
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span style="color:#333333;">“ANYBODY can become <b>angry</b>, that is easy; but to be <b>angry</b> with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the right way, that is not within everybody&#8217;s power, that is not easy.”</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>THE ART OF RHETORIC</strong> &#8211; Aristotle composed this over 2000 years ago.</span></p>
