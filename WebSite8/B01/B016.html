                <h2>Inhibition</h2>
                <p>“We had some food and then went to a bar. It was nice to catch up but he just seemed a bit insecure. It’s hard to explain.”</p>
                <p>Vincent lit the candle.</p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“Self-conscious?”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren nodded.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“After drinking he seemed to change. He was louder, more extroverted, talking to people that he didn’t know. As the night progressed he became meaner and more cynical. It wasn’t pretty.”<br /></span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent watched the flame.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“In vino veritas.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The phrase made Warren think of a night out with his friends a long time ago. They ended up outside a fast food place, talking to some girls that were as drunk as they were. One of them came out with something like, when people drink, the truth comes out.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“He always seems cheerful when he’s sober.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent looked at Warren.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“Too cheerful. It’s not that he is fake, it just feels a bit unnatural, like he doesn’t want to bring people down.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren looked at the sky.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“What are you like, when you, drink?”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent moved closer to the light. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“The same but my brain slows down.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The moon was almost full.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“No repressed feelings?”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent could feel the warmth on his face.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“I&#8217;m not that bothered by what people think of me therefore no repressed feelings. If I feel like doing something, I find a way of doing it.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent paused.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“In an email, a girl once told me that she always has one or two drinks before going out to reduce her anxiety. Then she asked if I thought that that was pathetic.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren&#8217;s throat felt dry.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“What did you say?”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent watched the flame again.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“Alcohol distorts your perception of reality and that I try to keep mine clear at all times.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren picked up his glass of water.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“Smooth.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent smiled.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“I asked her to go to a party with me and she said that she wasn’t ready to date yet. I responded by saying that it wasn’t a date and that I didn’t think that that was such a good idea because our ideas about life we’re very different. Being an astute philosophy graduate, she wanted to know what I meant in more depth and then things imploded.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent picked up the match box.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“The last thing she told me was that she didn’t want to be friends anymore. We haven’t seen or talked to each other in almost ten years. You’ll have to read my novel if you want the details.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren took a sip.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“Why are you smiling?”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent took one out.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“We are animals, we have instincts, we do not choose who or what we are drawn to. When you meet someone that you&#8217;re attracted to and you enjoy their company, a switch gets turned on because you feel that there is a potential. You want to get to know them better and in ideal circumstances this happens.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent slowly moved the sulphurous tip toward the fire.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">“However if they have issues with trust, put up a wall, wear a mask and play games. They do not let you get to know them and being rejected by someone that is jaded is funny because, they don’t know you very well, and you don’t know them, so it’s a bit like they don’t really know what they are rejecting.&#8221; </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">The match burst into life.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;It feels like they&#8217;re just running away.”</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Warren put his glass down.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;I hate philosophy students, they are so pretentious.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">Vincent watched the flame slowly turn the wood black.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t pretentious but she had problems.&#8221;</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">An insect flew by.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t we all.&#8221;</span></p>
