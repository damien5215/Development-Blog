                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>You get an idea. You fall in love with it. You write some scenes. You develop them. You find ways to weave them together. One glorious day you finish the first draft. You try to read it all the way through. You realize that there are structural problems. You fix them. Then you realize that forty percent of the writing is good but that the other sixty needs some serious editing. You begin editing and re-writing. Then things get tougher.</p>
                <p>When reading something that YOU wrote, which is bad (repetitive, cliche, trite, false, sloppy, etc), you get depressed and give up for a while. Eventually you get over your ego and read your bad writing over and over again. You start to understand why it’s bad. After a lot of meditation you think of ways to fix the bad bits. You do some of it. You realize that editing is not as fun as coming up with the first draft and you suspect that this is the reason that novels are hard to “finish”.</p>
                <p>You dream of the day that you will finish. You take steps to make you dream a reality. The words humility, diligence and fortitude become more important to you. You realize that you’ve become a better writer. You finish. You have created something which embodies and exposes the contents of your soul. You are finally at peace.</p>
                <p>You fall in love with another idea…</p>
