                <h2>Friends</h2>
                <p>A long time ago I made a friend. We met at a writing group. He was clerking at a barrister's office and had studied philosophy. I had a strong interest in Jean Paul Sartre so we were naturally drawn to each other. Another thing that we shared was the fact that we were both born on the same day, of the same month, of the same year! Our friendship lasted about two years. At a random party near Kings Cross we had a little fight. He was scared to mingle and was becoming abusive so I told him that he needed therapy. Things were never the same between us but our relationship had run its course.</p>
                <p>From time to time, I miss him. He was the smartest person that I had met at that group and when things were good, I learned a lot from him. We used to go to one of the large bookshops in the city, on a Saturday for lunch, quibbling over definitions, gossiping about the group, conducting social experiments, people watching, absorbing the atmosphere and talking about writing.</p>
                <p>He turned me onto “David Foster Wallace”. I can’t read DFW’s fiction because he was a maximalist and I am a minimalist. Despite this I enjoy DFW’s interviews on YT because he was a real “critical thinker”. My friends writing style seemed to be influenced by DFW and other postmodernists so we never could appreciate each other’s writing in a specific way however if we stayed general and conceptual, it was fine.</p>
                <p>My friend is white and I am brown. One time I told him about a young woman that I had recently met and was trying to get to know. The first question he asked me was, “Is she white?” I was stunned for a second but I realized that his directness was a result of the trust between us. This is quite unusual for two polite, reserved, middle class English guys. He felt that he could ask me anything and I felt like I could tell him anything, which we did. Perhaps it was the rebellious Aquarian energy that we  both shared.</p>
                <p>To Kill a Mocking Bird. The Second Sex. Lolita. Talking about things that are difficult or “sensitive” for whatever reason is the real challenge for any writer who wants to write something interesting. This is what I miss most about my old friend. He challenged me to think more. He even once told me that I was obsessed with dichotomies. All of these years later and I’m still in love with the idea of <b>balance</b>.</p>
                <p>I’ve come to realize that the most difficult kind of friendship is the one where the two people have a lot in common but also have one thing which is completely different. For me and my friend, our difference had to do with attitude. I was, and still am, a happy-go-lucky, idealist. My friend was jaded and strategic. Whenever he met someone that he liked, the first thing that he tried to do was to look for a wedding ring. Whenever I met someone that I liked, I just talked to them.</p>
                <p>Some people have motives when they go into a situation. They want something and so they try to assert some control, minimize risk, play games. These people who have issues with trust also tend to understand “the deep grammar of the lie”, using their powers of intuition for ill rather than good. If you can’t be honest, you can’t trust. If you can’t trust, you can’t be vulnerable. If you can be vulnerable, you can’t love.</p>
                <p>Other people, people who are more in touch with their inner-hippie, enter a situation without any intentions or motives. They see possibility and potential. If something happens, great but the hippie is not going to trick, manipulate or bully. They go with the flow, go with how they feel rather than what they think. At work I like being goal-oriented but at home I am a beatnik.</p>
                <p>Essentially it was this “calculating” part of his personality that I could not get on with. When he felt insecure he became abusive. Pulling somebody else down in order to feel better. It was gentle abuse but abuse is abuse, abuse is not ideal and as I mentioned earlier, I’m an idealist. I’ve experienced this ugly dynamic once before as a teenager and it inspired a few ideas in my first novel. Healthy relationships require <b>balance</b>.</p>
                <p>When people are in their teens, a bit of insecurity seems acceptable but once they reach their mid-twenties, it is unacceptable (PD). The next time that I make a “friend” like this I must remember not to expect too much.</p>
