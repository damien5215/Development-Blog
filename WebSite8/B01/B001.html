                <h2>Superior Self-Teachers</h2>
                <p>On the screen a woman that had dark hair took a handful of chocolate biscuits, broke them up and dropped the pieces into a food processor. The camera followed her hands as she picked up a slab of chocolate and added it. She closed the lid of the transparent machine and turned it on…</p>
                <p>Whilst editing something I showed a friend this excerpt and they were disturbed by the phrase highlighted in bold. They believed that it should’ve been,</p>
                <p><i>“On the screen a woman <b>who</b> had dark hair…”</i></p>
                <p>This prompted me to read about <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/427/should-you-use-who-or-that-when-talking-about-multiple-people-doing-somethin" target="_blank">relative pronouns</a>. If what you are referring to is a person and you want this to be explicit, you would use “who”. If your referring to an object then you would use “that”. People are objects so you can use “that” or “who”. Seeing as this paragraph is supposed to be fiction, I’m going to stick with “that”.</p>
                <p>It’s funny how native speakers don’t think about grammar yet compose functional sentences, most of them time. It’s a bit like a singer or musician who “hears” their way through a song rather than worrying about scales and chords.</p>
                <p>It made me aware of the fact that I don’t know many “academic” terms when it comes to literature and it reminded me of the term <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI2WLCschuc" target="_blank">Experiential Learning</a>. It is a concept that has stuck with me ever since I read the non-fiction book, “Moonwalking with Einstein” and developed a mild obsession with Ed Cooke. The idea is that we learn more effectively when we are having fun.</p>

                <p>
                    <i>
                        The mediocre teacher tells.<br>
                        The good teacher explains.<br>
                        The superior teacher demonstrates.<br>
                        The great teacher inspires.
                    </i>
                </p>

                <p>In our education system (UK, public) the emphasis seems to be on telling and explaining. Rarely do students get taught how theory is applied however geniuses, once exposed to some form of knowledge, are not content merely possessing it and passing exams, they are driven further. They want to know what it means, how it can be used. Geniuses are superior self-teachers (Feynman, Tesla, Ramanujan, Shakespeare). They study the world but this soon flips and the world ends up studying them because they brake rules and invent better ones to take their place.</p>
                <p>Anyway, without setting out to do so, I randomly made an association between “Nigella” and “relative pronouns”. This works because the area of my brain dedicated to celebrity-cooks is larger than the area of my brain dedicated to language-rules. Connecting new bits of information to old bits of information, that I care about, makes recalling the new piece of information a lot easier. For me, the term “relative pronouns” is now part of a story and this process is a large part of how to make learning fun.</p>
