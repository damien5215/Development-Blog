                <h2>Sartre and the Germans</h2>
                <p>One of my mothers best friends is German and in my early twenties my sister and I spent some time with her and her family. They were, and I’m sure still are, wonderful people. On their bookshelf sat volumes of Shakespeare, the husband was passionate about Gershwin’s music, the artistic daughters played cello and violin and everything in their house was structured, clean and beautiful.</p>
                <p>They all spoke English well and they encouraged me to practice my GCSE German however it was difficult. I can understand some basic vocabulary but when it came to speaking the language I was self-conscious. There are some “sounds” that are hard to mimic. I like to think that this has to do with “language acquisition” and the fact that the sounds that we learn to make as children are the ones we are limited to.</p>
                <p><i>“In linguistics, <b>umlaut</b> is a sound change in which a vowel is pronounced more like a following vowel or semivowel. The term umlaut was originally coined in connection with the study of Germanic languages, as it had occurred prominently in the history of many of them.”</i></p>
                <p>At the time I had discovered the joy of literature and had taken a book on Westcoast jazz with me. Inspired by “The Talented Mr Ripley”, I had become acquainted with some of Chet Baker’s best recordings and had worked out a few rudimentary voicings for all of the chords on my guitar for “My Funny Valentine”. During a family trip they played one of my CD’s in the car. On the disc there was Chet Baker’s interpretation of one of Gershwin’s compositions, “Embraceable You”. During the line that goes something like, “…my heart grows tip-see-ee-ee in me…”, the father had winced. He had been listening to the standard for many years and perhaps CB’s embellishment was not to his taste.</p>
                <p>On another day we made a trip to a library and I got them to hire a copy of Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”. They read it and seemed to find it interesting! This pleased me because it meant that we had similar taste in jazz and literature.</p>

                <p>At the time I had been thinking about Buddhist philosophy and I remember trying to tell her about it. My mother's friend told me about a philosopher called Jean Paul Sartre. When I got back to the UK, whenever I made my trips into the city, exploring large bookshops, I looked out for JPS and ended up reading the novels "Nausea" and "The Age of Reason". I also read a lot about Simone De Beauvoir, some of her books (She Came to Stay, The Prime of Life, etc) and their relationship. I can not claim to have understood everything that I read but it was inspiring and some of the concepts stuck with me. Essence precede existence. Ideas about freedom, responsibility for action, individuality and identity. I realised that Buddhist philosophy and existentialist philosophy were both ontological. I soon began thinking about the relationship between the two philosophies and these ideas fed directly into what I was writing.</p>

                <p>I kept in contact with one of the daughters and we exchanged many letters. I once sent her a description of an autumnal tree and she liked it but she did not like when I said something like the tree had lost 70% of it’s leaves. Some of the language I had used was vaguely poetic but numbers and percentages were silly in this context. Eventually I realized that she was right. Back then logic and philosophy came natural to me but I clearly had more to learn about mood and atmosphere. My graceful friend was plugged into nature and art and was there to challenge me. A year or two later we were on a bridge near Embankment and she was taking pictures of the scenic buildings. I strongly advised her to take pictures of the graffiti in one of the less-scenic tunnels. I wanted her to have a <b>balanced</b> perception of the city.</p>

                <p>To this day, they were the nicest and most beautiful people I have ever met. Whenever I meet people who disappoint me, all I have to do is think about this family and my faith in humanity is restored. They gave me a mug with a frog singing a song. I decided that it was too elaborate to use as a mug and elevated it to the status of ornament. It still sits on my desk, filled with empty pens.</p>
