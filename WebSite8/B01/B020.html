                <hr />

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>PLANNING AND GOAL-SETTING</strong><br />A few months ago, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t managing my time effectively. I was spending a lot time planning things but I didn&#8217;t action many of them. Then I started watching motivational videos. There is a lot of content out there about discipline, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PXloKm7GwU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shaolin monks</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-Cvl3_CH2A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navy Seals</a> and endurance athletes. I discovered</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkqjB-2YXqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Goggins</a> <span style="color:#333333;">and couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. I love how extreme he is. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">It inspired me I tried to try some extreme exercises but my body was way too unfit for it so I gave up. What it reminded me of is that, having a long term goal and plan, is something you have to chip away at everyday. I keep a diary so I&#8217;m good at documenting things however my planning and goal-setting needed some work.</span></p>

                <p><strong><span style="color:#333333;">EXCEL SHEETS</span><br /></strong><span style="color:#333333;">I created an excel sheet. <span style="font-size:inherit;">The first sheet (</span><em style="font-size:inherit;">Tasks</em><span style="font-size:inherit;">) is a large list of tasks and if they are related, they are stacked next to each other. </span><span style="font-size:inherit;">The second sheet (<em>9 to 5</em>) shows the schedule for the day from 9am to 1pm and 1pm to 5pm. Underneath this is a list of tasks. During the day I decide what to do and when. </span></span><span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-size:inherit;">T</span></span><span style="color:#333333;font-size:inherit;">he S means that the task has been started and the F means it has been finished. Once a task is completed and I don&#8217;t need to see it anymore, I move it down with all the other completed tasks.</span></p>

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE</strong><br />Another thing that I try to do, to make tasks more engaging, is to connect them to another more pleasurable activity. When I cook, I also listen to jazz FM hoping for a good tune to come on so I can sing along. Also I used to watch a video (TV) for 20 about minutes whilst holding an abdominal crunch. I need to do that more. Two birds with one stone. </span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;">With regard to coding practice, it has become habitual because of my <a href="https://github.com/damien5215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> activity bar. It&#8217;s become like a game. Every weekday I try to do at least 4 updates (push code to server). This ensures the green square for the day is a nice shade of green. Actually these green squares are probably what inspired me sub-consciously to make the &#8220;completed&#8221; squares in the excel sheet green.</span></p>

                <!--<p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>NEED AND WANT</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Essentially I try to divide all the tasks into two groups. Tasks I &#8220;need&#8221; to do and tasks I &#8220;want&#8221; to do. A few months ago when I was bored, I didn&#8217;t even know what I wanted to do. There were too many things. Once I wrote everything that I wanted to do on a piece of paper, I was able to organize them and make &#8220;actionable&#8221; plans. Then I made a list of the tasks that I needed to do (work) and said to myself if I complete task A (need) then I can do task B (want). This gave me incentive and passion to get the &#8220;need&#8221; tasks done. Being highly aware of what you want, makes you more engaged with the world. <em> </em>I do not <em>live to work</em>, I <em>work to live.</em></span></p>-->

                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>10 MINUTE RULE</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#333333;">Whenever I try to do some work that I&#8217;m not interested in, I make myself look at it for 5 to 10 minutes. All I do is read it and then do something else. This gives my sub-conscious time to think about it and eventually I get an idea. Then I tend to dive into the task. This really helps against procrastination and fear. I think it would be a good strategy for the kids in school who start their homework late.</span></p>
                <p><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>SELF LEARNING</strong><br />1. Look/watch the material (code). Do not make notes just take it in. <br />2. Make a list of the main topics that it covered. <br />3. Go over, one of them, in detail.<br />4. Do an example (implement something) and listen to music. <br />5. Move on to next topic.<br />6. Once completed document what you learned.<br /></span><span style="color:#333333;"> </span></p>
