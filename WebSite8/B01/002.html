                    <span style="color:#333333;">My sister did some doodles of cats recently and I like them. For the first three weeks of May, the weather was cold and rainy however for the past few days, it has improved. I got my first dose of vaccine last week, recorded some of my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X85OL2j5Uy4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">singing</a> and I&#8217;ve recently finished all seasons of &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;, I enjoyed it. New York in the late 50&#8217;s slash 60&#8217;s. The glamour. References to beatniks. I also discovered this tune &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtVjPqdoMD4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Punching Bag</a>&#8221; by Downer. I added it to my &#8220;Nu-Metal&#8221; playlist, made a CD and went for a drive. My tyre pressure sensor has been on for a while so I checked them. The tyres were fine apart from the rear left which was about 18 psi. </span>

Once I complete reading and notating one of these chunks, I will revamp the synopsis and cover letter. In other news, I&#8217;ve been watching some old-school anime on YT (Wicked City).

Right now I&#8217;m formatting the manuscript. I plan to print, one test copy, for proof-reading. Once I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;ll publish it! It would be fun to try and sell a few copies to people who appreciate &#8220;accessible-literary&#8221; fiction. I&#8217;ll make a little YT channel for it. Nothing crazy, just small and informative. When it comes to marketing I like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cZybM2iP4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted</a> and subtle approach. In other news the weather seems to be improving (double digits), almost 18m people have received 1st dose of vaccine and I discovered some good old TV content (early 00&#8217;s) by a director/writer called Annie Griffin. <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-book-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Book Group</a> is excellent. I also discovered an old anime (1996) called &#8220;<a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-vision-of-escaflowne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escaflowne</a>&#8221; and watched the first episode (dub). It was really good, I enjoyed every second. Wonderful art, charming characters and interesting story. I love &#8220;Channel 4 Online&#8221; (All 4).</span></p>

                    At the start of this year Adobe stopped supporting it’s flash player and issued an update which stopped the flash content rendering in web browsers. It is old technology and has been superseded by HTML5 however a lot of people are not ready to part with it. Eventually, after messing about with “C:\Windows\SysWOW64”, configuration files and file permissions, I discovered this <a href="https://gist.github.com/KuromeSan/56d8b724c0696b54f9f81994ae3591d1" target="_blank">person</a>. Changing a few bytes in a file fixed the problem and it was interesting because I’ve never used a hex editor before. Ghidra seems like a very cool tool.

Actually I came across a nice recording of a XMAS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD2ADCUOnDA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jazz</a> tune. I love the first solo and the interplay between the horn, the piano and the drums.

                    Before the pandemic I used to do my printing at the local library. I print my writing because I find it easier to read/edit a sheaf of paper rather than a screen. About two weeks ago I started looking at budget printers and eventually I settled on the Brother, HL-L2350DW. It is laser, mono (black/white) and it can do auto-duplex! Then on YT I came across a good review of this machine and I got excited. A 10-minute video, posted 2 years ago with 180k views (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5eVqw4Uws8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LINK</a>). I've printed 80+ pages. So far so good.

This is probably part of the reason why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Feynman</a> was so revered. Like all effective teachers, he enjoyed the challenge of explaining something. Really this is about being able to work with things in detail and broadly. Think globally, act locally.

                    NC, C23 was a two page scene. It took place in an arcade and the dialogue was okay. I felt the scene was too short because the average length of a chapter/scene in NC is 5 pages. Whilst daydreaming I imagined the characters travelling (walk/train) from the arcade to my one of my favourite places to eat (Thai Express in Aldgate). This allowed me to extend the scene, add descriptions and more dialogue. I ended up with more structure (a beginning, middle and an end) and the scene is now 10 pages. NC is over 200 pages and I’m happier with it but I need to read it all again.

                    The weather has cooled down and I’ve been doing some exercise. At the moment my regime consists of brisk walking, core strengthening and free weights. To facilitate this activity I made a playlist on Spotify. At the moment, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2OlyitojlEKUudls9NNZ8E?si=gU-txe1mRh-kAyj8P4Yu5w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NuMetal Grooves</a> is 25 minutes long (6 tracks), each song follows on from one another and they all groove hard. The lyrics tend to be juvenile but the music is fun and passionate. The only problem is that the Crazy Town tracks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dmqtyh3WSs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B-Boy 2000</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn3RoIRVLZ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lollipop &amp;^%$</a>, are censored!

                    It was hot today (mid-thirties). So hot the sky looked as if it was burning. Also, whilst browsing “amazon prime” I came across, “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”. In secondary school a lot of my friends liked it but the show seemed silly to me. Last week I watched season 1 and I’m currently consuming season 2. It has charm and atmosphere. One of my best friends was a huge fan and used to record the episodes (VHS). He once told me about an episode called “passion” (S2E17). That is the next episode that I’m about to watch! When the student is ready, the teacher appears.

                    I tried an oat-so-simple yesterday. Cinnamon. It was amazing. Also, this month, I’ve had access to “Disney Plus”. I’ve been watching the good episodes of “Disney Doug”, “X-Men TAS”, all of the Mighty Ducks movies, etc. I went shopping for supplies. 25% of people were wearing masks. Next week will be interesting.

                    When learning new things (<a href="http://www.text.damienasp.com/006.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev</a>) my approach seems to be watch the video and then do something else for a while. I like to let the ideas sit in my <b>subconscious</b>, giving my mind time to speculate in a vague and general way, allowing my curiosity to grow. Then I watch it again and I’m more engaged so I take a few notes.

                    Over the past week it has been hot (30+ degrees) and humid. It rained last night and it’s cooler today. 20 degrees is my favourite temperature. According to “BBC weather”, it’s about that temperature right now but the humidity is quite high. I recently put air in my tyres. They should all be 30 psi. They were all close apart from the “rear left”. That was 18 psi! My sister used the clippers. A “number 5” all over, my usual haircut, it looks good.

                    Whilst tidying one of my shelves I came across a print out of a short scene. It was something one of my writing friends (the one that checks for wedding rings) had written a long time ago. I remember at the time I didn’t understand it. I gave it a read and I figured out what was going on. Nothing much happens and it is quite cryptic but it builds tension. It’s literary fiction.

                    I was watching “Sky” and on the channel “LondonLive” I came across a funny short web-series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiSUfDmtyzQ&list=PLxggddpIvXgY6n2jOZTQRH9zELcHjGs7q&index=1" target="_blank">Content Content</a>. It came out in Nov/Dec 2019 and it’s about a small “digital content agency” in London. There are 5 of them and the average age seems to be about 26 and I just really like the characters. The plots are silly and some of the jokes are quite cheap but I do like the cast’s chemistry.

                    Before sleeping last night I listened to “Ostinato”, a piece on Brad Mehldau’s album “After Bach”. More classical than jazz, I used to think Brad pretentious but I’ve recently seen the light. He is just remarkably sensitive.

                    I finished editing the diary. Now there are just the final ten pages to edit. I’ve just watched a movie called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYOJefimILA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tart</a>” (2001) and I found something compelling about Dominique Swain and how she expressed the apathy, depression and courage of her character.

                    I sang a bit today. I did “Deftones – Feiticeira”, “Weezer – Say It Ain’t So” and “AIC – Them Bones”. It was good. Then I did my favourite “passaggio” exercise. Playing a C#5 on my guitar whilst singing a “la”, matching the note then going down chromatically all the way down to F2. Each phrase, 4 or 5 notes, “la la la la la”, C#5 C5 B5 Bb5 A5, etc. Like most people I have a “usable” range of 2.5 octaves.

                    Novels are written in exciting bursts, pages of unrefined gold but they are edited one brutal page at a time, several drafts. The chapter that I’m currently editing is a diary. It is 11 pages long and I’m on page 4. All I’m doing is sharpening the paragraphs, making it more readable, more concise.

                    Nice guys finish last. The phrase disturbed me until I realised that what I am, or what I aspire to be, is fair rather than nice. Fair guys are nice to people who deserve it and indifferent to those who don’t. Indifferent, not mean. An eye for an eye and the whole world will go blind. Seek justice, not revenge. Fair guys finish somewhere in the middle.

                    I looked at “novel 1” again, went over the synopsis and I’m happy with it. Then I turned my attention to the manuscript. 75% is solid so I’m giving the 25% which is soft, more attention. This means some light editing, restructuring and rewriting. Rewriting a scene can be tricky because I need to be inspired and that requires going outside and doing something interesting. During the “lock-down” that is not possible therefore I’m going to have be more inventive.

I recently found a YT channel with a lot of good UK period dramas, late-80s slash early-90s. Lost Empires was passionate, immersive and interesting. It’s about a theater group just before WW1.
